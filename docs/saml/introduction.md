# SAML Introduction

The Helpmonks Single-Sign-On plugins enables the option to have your users sign in with SAML v2. If you are working with a partner that has implemented a SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) identity provider, you can use this plugin to interoperate with it, thereby enabling SSO for customers. It works with any IDP providers, including OneLogin, Auth0, Okta, Ping Identity, ADFS, Salesforce, SharePoint.

## Enable the Single-Sign-On plugin for your account

First let's check that you enabled the SSO (Single-Sign-On) plugin (please note that the SSO plugin is only available in our "GO FURTHER" plan). To do so, go to the plugin section in your Helpmonks account (you need to be an Administrator). If you see "SSO" in the left navigation you are good and can go to the next section.

To enable the SSO plugin, please click on the "Plugins directory" button in the right corner. Then from the list of plugins, go to the "SSO" plugin and enable it in the detail section.


## Important

Helpmonks is not an Identity provider. You need to have a working Identity provider. In addition, you need to create your users in Helpmonks and assign them to your mailboxes. Automatic creation of users in Helpmonks is currently not supported. Though, it's very easy to batch create users. Simply import them from a CSV file.

That said, please continue on to [setting up SAML](../setup/).
